# Tech stack
- Vue 3
- Vite
- TailwindCSS

## Cloning
I recommend using `npx degit` to clone without having to fork and stuff. Some credit would be kind but its totally up to you!

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/TheNerdMan/vue-aframe.git
```

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously Volar) and disable Vetur
